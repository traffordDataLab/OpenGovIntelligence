# <span style="color: #ccc;">Trafford Worklessness Pilot:</span> [<span style="color: #e24a90;">Scan</span>](http://www.trafforddatalab.io/opengovintelligence/scan.html)

#### Background
This web application has been developed by the [<span style="color: #e24a90;">Trafford Data Lab</span>](https://www.trafforddatalab.io/) as part of the European Union funded [<span style="color: #e24a90;">OpenGovIntelligence</span>](http://www.opengovintelligence.eu) project. It is the result of a co-creation exercise involving [<span style="color: #e24a90;">Trafford Council</span>](http://www.trafford.gov.uk/residents/residents.aspx), the [<span style="color: #e24a90;">Greater Manchester Combined Authority</span>](https://www.greatermanchester-ca.gov.uk/) and the [<span style="color: #e24a90;">Department for Work and Pensions</span>](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-work-pensions) to help reduce worklessness across the Greater Manchester region.
>The OpenGovIntelligence project aims to modernize Public Administration by connecting it to Civil Society through the innovative application of Linked Open Statistical Data (LOSD). We believe the publication of high quality public statistics can transform society, services and enterprises throughout Europe.

The application is part of a [<span style="color: #e24a90;">suite of tools</span>](http://www.trafforddatalab.io/opengovintelligence/) that visualise linked open statistical data relating to worklessness to help identify need and locate assets or groups that could support the delivery of Jobcentre Plus services.

#### The app
The map visualises the spatial distribution of key indicators relating to worklessness using a technique called Local Indicators of Spatial Association [<span style="color: #e24a90;">(Anselin, 1995)</span>](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1538-4632.1995.tb00338.x/abstract). The map shows Lower-layer Super Output Areas (LSOAs) which typically contain around 1,500 residents or 400 households as statistically significant **spatial clusters** (High-High and Low-Low) or **spatial outliers** (Low-High and High-Low). An LSOA marked 'High-High' exhibits positive spatial autocorrelation because it has high values of x and is surrounded by areas with similarly high values. Conversely, an LSOA marked 'High-Low' indicates negative spatial autocorrelation because it records a high value of x and is surrounded by areas with low values.
By hovering over the LSOAs on the map, information such as the indicator value, electoral ward and deprivation data are displayed in the panel.
There are a number of map options available. Hovering over the layer icon below the zoom control (+ - buttons) displays choices for the map backgrounds, such as road atlas and satellite views, as well as the locations of Jobcentre Plus offices which can be overlaid on the map.
